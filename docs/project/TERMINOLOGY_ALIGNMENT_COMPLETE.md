# ✅ Terminology Alignment with HRM Paper - Complete

**Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Fully aligned with HRM paper terminology  
**Commit:** `e98da4f`

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue:** We were using "inner/outer iterations" which conflicted with HRM paper's "inner/outer loops"

**Solution:** Aligned all terminology with HRM paper while maintaining backward compatibility

---

## 📚 Official Terminology (HRM-Aligned)

### From HRM Paper:
- **HRM inner loop** = f_L (low-level, fast module)
- **HRM outer loop** = f_H (high-level, slow module)

### Our Contribution:
- **Refinement iterations** = R multi-step processing (was: "inner iterations")
- **Training steps** = gradient descent (was: "outer iterations")

### Three Distinct Concepts:

```
1. HRM Inner Loop (f_L)
   - Updates every refinement step
   - Fast, reactive processing
   - Part of controller timescales

2. HRM Outer Loop (f_H)  
   - Updates every T refinement steps (T=4)
   - Slow, strategic planning
   - Part of controller timescales

3. Refinement Iterations (R=12)
   - Multi-step processing per forward pass
   - Our architectural contribution
   - NOT the same as HRM loops!

4. Training Steps
   - Standard gradient descent
   - Optimization outer loop
   - NOT refinement iterations!
```

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Code Updates

**src/pot/modules/block.py:**
```python
# OLD (confusing):
class IterRefiner:
    def __init__(self, stack, max_inner_iters=1):
        self.K = max_inner_iters  # K for "inner"
    
    def forward(self, x):
        for t in range(self.K):  # "inner iterations"
            ...

# NEW (HRM-aligned):
class IterRefiner:
    """
    TERMINOLOGY CLARIFICATION:
    - "Refinement iterations" (this module) = apply stack R times
    - "HRM inner loop" (controller) = f_L updates every step
    - "HRM outer loop" (controller) = f_H updates every T steps
    """
    def __init__(self, stack, max_inner_iters=1):  # Param name kept for backward compat
        self.R = max_inner_iters  # R for "refinement"
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # --- No ACT: simple R refinement steps ---
        for t in range(self.R):  # "refinement iterations"
            ...
```

**Key changes:**
- ✅ Internal variable: `self.K` → `self.R`
- ✅ Comments: "inner iterations" → "refinement iterations"
- ✅ Docstrings: Added terminology clarification
- ✅ Parameter: `max_inner_iters` kept (backward compat)

### 2. Documentation Created

**docs/TERMINOLOGY_GUIDE.md** (NEW):
- ✅ Quick reference table
- ✅ Official HRM-aligned definitions
- ✅ Three nested loops explained
- ✅ Code examples
- ✅ Teaching guide with analogies
- ✅ Migration guide from old terms
- ✅ Checklist for contributors

### 3. README Updates

**Before:**
```markdown
- Inner iterations: 12
- Outer iterations: training steps
- Inner loop: f_L
- Outer loop: f_H
```

**After:**
```markdown
- Refinement iterations: R=12
- Training steps: gradient descent  
- HRM inner loop: f_L (fast, updates every refinement step)
- HRM outer loop: f_H (slow, updates every T steps)
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Key Components: Clear f_L/f_H descriptions
- ✅ Terminology warning with link to guide
- ✅ Examples use "refinement steps" not "inner iterations"
- ✅ Tables updated: "Refinement Steps (R)" column
- ✅ Hierarchy: Added HRM Controller
- ✅ Ablations: Added HRM outer loop period (T)

## 📊 Terminology Comparison

| Concept | HRM Paper | Old PoH Term | New PoH Term |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| f_L (fast) | Inner loop | ~~Confusing~~ | **HRM inner loop** |
| f_H (slow) | Outer loop | ~~Confusing~~ | **HRM outer loop** |
| Multi-step | N/A | ~~Inner iterations~~ | **Refinement iterations (R)** |
| Optimization | N/A | ~~Outer iterations~~ | **Training steps** |

## ✅ Backward Compatibility

### What Changed:
- ✅ Internal variable: `self.K` → `self.R`
- ✅ All comments and docstrings
- ✅ README and documentation prose

### What DIDN'T Change:
- ✅ Parameter name: `max_inner_iters` (still works!)
- ✅ Config files: `max_inner_iters: 12` (still valid)
- ✅ User code: No breaking changes
- ✅ Experiment scripts: Still functional

**Result:** Existing code continues to work, but documentation is now clear!

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Correct (HRM-aligned):

```python
# Code
refiner = IterRefiner(stack, max_inner_iters=12)  # 12 refinement steps

# Prose
"The model performs 12 refinement iterations per forward pass.
During each refinement step, the HRM inner loop (f_L) updates,
and every 4 steps, the HRM outer loop (f_H) updates."
```

### Incorrect (ambiguous):

```python
# Code (still works, but avoid in new code)
refiner = IterRefiner(stack, max_inner_iters=12)  # Don't say "inner iterations"

# Prose (confusing!)
"The model performs 12 inner iterations per forward pass.
The inner loop updates every step, the outer loop every 4 steps."
```

## 🎓 Teaching the Terminology

### For New Users:

**Step 1: HRM Controller**
"The HRM has two loops from the paper:
- f_L (HRM inner loop): fast, reactive - like instinctive responses
- f_H (HRM outer loop): slow, strategic - like careful planning"

**Step 2: Refinement**
"PoH adds refinement: the model processes the input R=12 times.
Think of it like editing an essay multiple times - each pass refines it."

**Step 3: Training**
"Like any model, we train with gradient descent.
Each training step does one forward pass (with R=12 refinement iterations)."

### Analogy:

```
HRM loops = Kahneman's "Thinking Fast and Slow"
  - Inner loop (f_L) = System 1 (fast, automatic)
  - Outer loop (f_H) = System 2 (slow, deliberate)

Refinement = Iterative problem solving
  - Like solving a puzzle: try, refine, try again
  - R=12 iterations finds the sweet spot

Training = Learning from experience
  - Standard backpropagation
  - Improve over many examples
```
