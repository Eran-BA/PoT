## 🏆 TOP 5 TASKS WHERE PoH SHINES

### 1. **Dependency Parsing** (BEST MATCH) 🥇

**Why PoH Excels:**
- ✅ **Structured Output**: Each token points to exactly one head (pointer network!)
- ✅ **Iterative Refinement**: Parse decisions depend on other decisions (e.g., subject affects verb attachment)
- ✅ **Hard Constraints**: Tree structure, projectivity, non-cyclicity
- ✅ **Ambiguity**: PP-attachment, coordination require reasoning

**Expected Improvement:** +15-30% UAS on complex sentences

**Evidence:**
- Your UD parsing experiments show PoH helps
- Biaffine pointer naturally fits this task
- Multiple iterations resolve attachment ambiguities

**Example:**
```
"The cat on the mat sat."
Iteration 1: [rough parse, local attachments]
Iteration 2: [refine based on verb frame]
Iteration 3: [resolve PP-attachment]
```

**Datasets:**
- Universal Dependencies (UD) - 100+ languages
- Penn Treebank (PTB)
- OntoNotes

---

### 2. **Coreference Resolution** 🥈

**Why PoH Excels:**
- ✅ **Pointer Structure**: Each mention points to antecedent (natural PoH fit!)
- ✅ **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: "John ... he ... his car" requires transitive links
- ✅ **Long Dependencies**: Can span 50+ tokens
- ✅ **Ambiguity**: Pronoun resolution needs context refinement

**Expected Improvement:** +20-40% on hard anaphora

**PoH Advantage:**
```
"Alice told Bob that she would help him."
        ↓              ↓            ↓
Iteration 1: she → Alice? Bob? (ambiguous)
Iteration 2: she → Alice (subject preference)
Iteration 3: him → Bob (confirmed via discourse)
```

**Datasets:**
- CoNLL-2012 (OntoNotes)
- GAP (Gender-Ambiguous Pronouns)
- WikiCoref

**Why Better Than Baseline:**
- Baseline: Pairwise scoring, greedy clustering
- PoH: Iterative refinement of entire chain, head specialization for different mention types

---

### 3. **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)** 🥉

**Why PoH Excels:**
- ✅ **Argument Attachment**: Each argument points to its predicate
- ✅ **Frame Disambiguation**: Verb sense affects argument structure
- ✅ **Nested Structures**: Arguments can have sub-arguments
- ✅ **Long-Distance**: Arguments far from predicates

**Expected Improvement:** +10-25% on implicit arguments

**PoH Advantage:**
```
"John promised Mary to help."
Iteration 1: "to help" ARG1 → John? Mary?
Iteration 2: Verb frame "promise" → controller = John
Iteration 3: Confirm ARG0=John, ARG1=Mary, ARG2=to help
```

**Datasets:**
- CoNLL-2009 (SRL)
- PropBank
- FrameNet

---

### 4. **Relation Extraction (RE)** 

**Why PoH Excels:**
- ✅ **Entity-Pair Reasoning**: Multiple relations in same sentence
- ✅ **Distant Supervision**: Noisy labels require refinement
- ✅ **Multi-Hop Relations**: A→B→C implies A→C
- ✅ **Negative Sampling**: Most pairs have no relation

**Expected Improvement:** +15-30% on distant supervision

**PoH Advantage:**
```
"Obama was born in Hawaii and became president."
Iteration 1: Extract entities
Iteration 2: Candidate relations (born_in, became)
Iteration 3: Refine with constraints (president ≠ location)
```

**Datasets:**
- TACRED
- DocRED (document-level)
- NYT Distant Supervision

---

### 5. **Multi-Hop Question Answering**

**Why PoH Excels:**
- ✅ **Evidence Aggregation**: Multiple passages needed
- ✅ **Reasoning Chains**: Q → Evidence1 → Evidence2 → Answer
- ✅ **Pointer Mechanism**: Attend to different passages per hop
- ✅ **Iterative**: Each hop refines attention

**Expected Improvement:** +8-15% on hard multi-hop

**PoH Advantage:**
```
Q: "Where was the composer of 'Ode to Joy' born?"
Hop 1: "Ode to Joy" → Beethoven (PoH routes to "who" heads)
Hop 2: Beethoven → born in Bonn (PoH routes to "where" heads)
Answer: Bonn
```

**Datasets:**
- HotpotQA
- 2WikiMultiHopQA
- MuSiQue

## ⚠️ MODERATE FIT TASKS

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
**Why Only Moderate:**
- ❌ Mostly local context (2-5 token window)
- ✅ But: Nested entities, rare entities benefit from iteration
- **Use PoH for:** Biomedical NER, nested entities, zero-shot transfer

### Machine Translation (MT)
**Why Only Moderate:**
- ❌ Transformers already iterative (decoder layers)
- ✅ But: Rare words, low-resource languages benefit
- **Use PoH for:** Low-resource MT, morphologically rich languages

### Abstractive Summarization
**Why Only Moderate:**
- ❌ Generation, not inference
- ✅ But: Content selection (encoder) can use PoH
- **Use PoH for:** Encoder routing to salient content

---

## ❌ POOR FIT TASKS

### 1. **Sentiment Analysis**
**Why PoH Fails:**
- Task too simple (linear classifier on [CLS] sufficient)
- No structured output
- No iterative reasoning needed
- **Verdict:** Massive overkill, likely worse than baseline

### 2. **Text Classification (Topic, Intent, etc.)**
**Why PoH Fails:**
- Single label output
- Pooling + linear layer is optimal
- No dependencies to model
- **Verdict:** PoH adds complexity with no benefit

### 3. **Language Modeling**
**Why PoH Fails:**
- Autoregressive generation (left-to-right)
- No iterative refinement possible
- Perplexity doesn't benefit from routing
- **Verdict:** Incompatible architecture

---

## 🔬 TASK CHARACTERISTICS THAT FAVOR PoH

### ✅ Strong Indicators (Use PoH):
1. **Pointer/Structured Output**: Each token points to another token
2. **Long Dependencies**: >10 token spans common
3. **Partial Observability**: Missing info, ambiguity, noise
4. **Iterative Reasoning**: Decision A affects decision B
5. **Hard Constraints**: Tree structure, non-overlap, etc.
6. **Multi-Hop**: Transitive reasoning required
7. **Attention Specialization**: Different heads for different relation types

### ❌ Warning Signs (Avoid PoH):
1. **Simple Classification**: Single label output
2. **Local Context**: 2-5 token window sufficient
3. **No Dependencies**: Independent predictions
4. **Autoregressive**: Left-to-right generation
5. **High Accuracy Already**: >95% with baseline
6. **Fast Inference Required**: Real-time constraints
7. **Small Models**: <100M params (not enough heads to specialize)

## 📊 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE GAINS

### By Task Difficulty:

| Difficulty | Baseline Accuracy | PoH Improvement | Iterations | Example Task |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Very Hard** | 50-70% | +20-40% | 12-16 | Coreference (hard anaphora) |
| **Hard** | 70-85% | +10-25% | 8-12 | Dependency parsing (complex) |
| **Medium** | 85-92% | +5-12% | 4-8 | NER (nested entities) |
| **Easy** | 92-98% | +0-5% | 2-4 | NER (standard) |
| **Very Easy** | >98% | Negative | N/A | Sentiment (binary) |

**Key Insight:** PoH improvement is **inversely proportional** to baseline accuracy. The harder the task, the more PoH helps.

## 💡 SUMMARY: PoH SWEET SPOT

**PoH shines when:**
- ✅ Task has **structured output** (pointers, trees, graphs)
- ✅ **Hard inference problem** (70-85% baseline accuracy)
- ✅ **Long-range dependencies** (>10 tokens)
- ✅ **Iterative reasoning** helps (ambiguity, constraints)
- ✅ Enough **model capacity** for head specialization (≥8 heads)

**Best tasks (in order):**
1. Dependency Parsing 🥇
2. Coreference Resolution 🥈
3. Semantic Role Labeling 🥉
4. Relation Extraction
5. Multi-Hop QA

**Avoid PoH for:**
- ❌ Simple classification (sentiment, topic)
- ❌ Autoregressive generation (LM, MT decoder)
- ❌ Tasks with >95% baseline accuracy

---

**Bottom Line:** PoH is a **structured prediction specialist**, not a general-purpose architecture. Deploy it where inference is hard and reasoning is iterative.
