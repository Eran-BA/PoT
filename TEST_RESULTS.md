## Known Issues & Limitations

### Non-Critical

1. **Max prob variance**: In diagnostic smoke test, max probability didn't increase monotonically
   - **Cause**: Random seed dependent behavior
   - **Impact**: None (entropy and specialization still work correctly)
   - **Status**: Expected behavior, not a bug

2. **NaN in CI**: Single-seed runs show `nan` for standard deviation
   - **Cause**: Only 1 seed in quick smoke test
   - **Impact**: None (expected for n=1)
   - **Status**: Expected, resolved in multi-seed runs

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready Now)

## Recommendations

### For Production Use

1. **Use HRM for**:
   - Hard tasks (length 20+, high uncertainty)
   - Tasks requiring multi-step reasoning
   - When you have 8+ inner iterations

2. **Use Standard PoH for**:
   - Easy tasks (length 12-, low uncertainty)
   - When you need fast inference
   - When you have < 4 iterations

3. **Hyperparameters**:
   - Start with T=4 (balanced timescales)
   - Use topk=3-4 (moderate sparsity)
   - Temperature: 2.0 → 0.7 over training
   - Entropy reg: 1e-3 (decay to 0 late in training)

### For Debugging

1. **If routing collapses**: Increase temperature, add entropy reg
2. **If no specialization**: Reduce topk, lower controller LR
3. **If NaN in training**: Clip gradients, reduce LR
4. **If H never updates**: Check state threading
