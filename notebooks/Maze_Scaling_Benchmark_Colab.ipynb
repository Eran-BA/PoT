        "\n",
        "This notebook uses the [maze-dataset](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-dataset) library for high-quality maze generation with controllable difficulty.\n",
        "\n",
        "## ✨ Key Improvements:\n",
        "- ✅ **Proper algorithms**: DFS, Wilson's, Prim's (we use DFS for challenging mazes)\n",
        "- ✅ **Path length filtering**: Control difficulty by minimum solution length\n",
        "- ✅ **Guaranteed solvable**: No unsolvable mazes\n",
        "- ✅ **Long planning horizons**: Force 80+ step solutions for differentiation\n",
        "\n",
        "## Models Compared:\n",
        "- **Baseline**: Standard Transformer encoder-decoder\n",
        "- **PoH-HRM**: Pointer-over-Heads with Hierarchical Reasoning Module\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Proper Generation Matters:\n",
        "**Old approach** (random walls): Path length ~16-20 → All models get 100% ❌  \n",
        "**New approach** (DFS + filtering): Path length 80+ → Clear differentiation ✅\n",
        "\n",
        "## Recommended Starting Point:\n",
        "- **Maze Size**: 20×20 (large enough to be challenging)\n",
        "- **Min Path Length**: 80 (20% of grid size)\n",
        "- **Training**: 300-500 mazes\n",
        "- **Goal**: Test if HRM provides advantage on long-horizon planning\n",
